    "The task involves the creation of a backtesting software to evaluate the performance of a specified set of stocks known as the \"Magnificent 7\" (Microsoft [MSFT], Apple [AAPL], Nvidia [NVDA], Amazon [AMZN], Google [GOOG], Meta [META], Tesla [TSLA]) in the US stock market. The program should employ the Double Bollinger Bands strategy as the basis for trading signals or any other strategy that you deem more applicable. For further details on this strategy, refer to the comprehensive guide available at (https://www.3candlereversal.com/post/kathy-lien-s-double-bollinger-band-strategy).  \n",
